# Wikapy

A wiki bot for simple dictation of all your wikipedia questions!

Wikapy uses Text-To-Speech and Speech-To-Text (yes them boys!) to simply be a wiki-guide to all the information you might need to get through the boundless realm of the wiki. 

**Dependencies**
```
  wikipedia
  speech_recognition
  win32api
  win32con
  BeautifulSoup
  google
  pyHook
  pythoncom
  pyttsx
```
**Usage**
```
  Press ~ once to initiate the bot
  Then the user can press "?" any-time to speak the query 
  For e.g. press "?" and just say "Mumbai" and the bot speaks up the summary paragraph of Wikipedia
```

**TODO**
- A beautiful GUI 
- Functionalities such as info-box parsing, page-links etc  
- A wiki-page for the project :)
